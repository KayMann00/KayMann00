Hi, I’m Kayleigh Mannering 
I’m passionate about data analytics and all things data!
I’m currently learning data science and all the tools and techniques involved in working with data. 
I’m particularly interested in building Power BI reports and Tableau dashboards, and I am also strengthening my skills in SQL and Python.
